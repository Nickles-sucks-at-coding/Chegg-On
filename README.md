This project is just a fun project, i am doing because i have nothing better to do and wanted to learn about networking.
Also i find Chegg pretty cool

If you dont know what Chegg is, it is a minecraft minigame created by the youtuber gerg.
Here is the video for it: https://youtu.be/ciZCvS2PKNA

This project is not planned to be really used by anyone, except for maybe my friends.
The reason is not only that it will absolutely suck, the main reason is actually that the game can easily let other people find out your ip address.
So playing the game with strangers is not recommanded

The reason why other people can see your ip is, that the game doesnt have a central server where all the games run on or data gets send through.
Instead you are directly connected with the game host, who will be is this case the server.
Because of that the other person can find out your ip address if he knows how to

Fun Fact: the Join Code is just an encrypted version of the host's ip address, with some other values that make sure you can only join the lobby if it recently created (one day differance or when the host copies the code again, because then the join id changes)

Also: Chegg-On stands for Chegg-Online, if you didnt already guess that

Also also: Chegg-on this nuts
